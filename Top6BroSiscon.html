                    Even from the beginning, the story’s drama gets to the peak when “the beast” confesses a love toward “beauty”. 
                    Then, a series of different breathtaking events brings a lot of surprise, which includes brocon, siscon, the ugly, the pretty, and so on. 
                    A tsundere does not dare to confess her feeling toward a pervert. A little girl always feels embarrassed at swimming because of her D-cup boobs but 
                    is attached to a loquacious senpai always talking about swimming. And many others.<br>
                    A mutual affection hindered by conditional differences or a romantic love story suddenly concluded has raised difficult-to-describe feelings.<br>
                    Gradually, the plot becomes more and more transparent, and it gets easier to get through the story’s content. 
                    The confusing message behind the anime – “love” – is finally exposed in an ingenious way.

                    This anime is only for over-17 adults. It tells us a story of a magical world that was formed nearly a hundred years ago. 
                    In a spring, the Magic High School welcomes its news students, and excellent students with high scores are called the Bloom, 
                    while the students scored in the bottom half are called the Weed.<br>
                    Two brothers Tatsuya and Miyuki Shiba are ranked Weed and Bloom, respectively. 
                    While Miyuki’s performance is impressive, her brother Tatsuya scored pretty low with his magic exam.<br>
                    Tatsuya is a visionary, and Miyuka has a special feeling towards her brother. 
                    After those two students get into the school, its original peaceful environment no longer exists.
