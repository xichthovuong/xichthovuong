                <img src="Baratie.jpg" alt="Restaurant Above Ocean" width="100%" height="500vh"> <br>
                <p>
                    Baratie is a big restaurant lying on a fish-shaped ship floating on the ocean, where former Cook Pirates captain Zeff “Red-leg” and 
                    23 other chefs are ready to serve a variety of delicious meals for any visitors. Initially, the ship has three floors, with one restaurant area, 
                    one kitchen, and a resort area. Gradually, it has been extended with two additional restaurant areas. 
                    If you are not seasick, Baratie is the best restaurant on the ocean!

                    If you are a connoisseur of sushi and want to enjoy a new and unique kind of sushi, Sushi Sushi restaurant in Durarara!! will be a perfect place. 
                    This restaurant menu is composed of different kinds of strange sushi, such as fried-chicken sushi, prosciutto sushi, cheese sushi, and so on.

                    A restaurant for gentlemen results from a 21-year-old adolescent – who works in Casetta dell'Orso after graduating a cooking school. 
                    Scrumptious wine, Italian cuisine, and a homey environment are three of numerous reasons behind this restaurant’s success.

                <p>
                    Yukihira restaurant is where visitors could enjoy a lot of amazing meals. In the third series of Food Wars!: 
                    Shokugeki no Soma, Soma has a risk of being expulsed again if he could not attract enough customers to the restaurant in the festive time. 
                    The issue becomes even worse when he dares to confront Terunori Kuga – the King of Chinese Cuisine. 
                    Soma determinatively creates a chain of food carts right in front of Kuga’s working place. He also invents Time Fuse Mapo Curry Noodles and Hujiao Bing. 
                    The result should be positive, right?

                <p>
                    Yōshoku means Western food. Neko means cat, but in this case, it means “the girl”. You’ve guessed it right! It’s that “girl”. 
                    Not only serving luxurious Western food, the restaurant also secretly opens on Saturday to provide its “special customers” with “special meals”.
                    This Western-style restaurant, though, is located at an impoverished corner of a shopping center.

                <p>
                    Tawara Noodles is a restaurant specialized in udon with a subtle address, as it is located at Kagawa, the smallest district in Japan. 
                    Though the land’s area is pretty humble, Kagawa has even more than 700 udon restaurants.
                    In Tawara Noodles, there is a super delicious udon that diners could not find anywhere else. It’s also rumored that this noodle is highly… addictive!
