                <p>
                    As a smart boy, Hyouka always takes over a… passive position in any situation. Simplicity, monotony, and tedium could be the exact words to describe this boy.

                <p>
                    Bakemonogatari is an anime famous for making an overwhelming use of interior monologue. 
                    The world is majorly portrayed throughout Araragi’s feelings and thoughts. 
                    This boy always possesses a thorough opinion on every event happening in his world, but it’s not common to hear such an opinion out loud. 
                    As a result, Koyomi Araragi is one of the best representatives of introverted Anime characters.

                <p>
                    L from Death Note is also a famous introverted character. 
                    He is a mysterious guy keeping numerous secrets and never appears in the public. 
                    His insight can be considered as invincible, making him Kira’s formidable opponent. 
                    L is always in the process of… thinking alone. Everybody knows nothing about him except he is an amazing detective.

                <p>
                    Tachibana appears in the anime as a villain who is the Student Council President desiring a “new world” and suppressing the SSS Movement. 
                    Always whispering and decently behaving represent her personality of an introvert. The lack of emotions makes people think she is indifferent. 
                    Only when Otonashi initiates a conversation with Tachibana, her thoughts are gradually revealed.
