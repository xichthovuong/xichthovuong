                <h3>1) “Gaffe” Moments</h3> <br>
                <!--<img src="TheSeven.jpg" alt="The Seven Deadly Sins Poster" width="100%" height="500vh"> <br>-->
                <p>
                    Asian and European conceptions about sex are widely varied, and manga writers seem to possess more freedom in composing than anime producers. 
                    Once broadcasted on the screen, an anime is likely to attract a lot of small kids. And no author wants a kid to watch too sensitive of a scene.<br>
                    The scene in which Goku finds out Bulma’s true gender is one of the most memorable detail of the manga. 
                    In the anime version, the artists had to alter the view and edit certain minor details to avoid “the disaster”.                        
                </p>
            </li>

            <li id="Graphic">
                <h3>2) Graphic Violence</h3> <br>
                <!--<img src="OnePunch2.jpg" alt="One Punch Man season 2 poster" width="100%" height="500vh"> <br>-->
                <p>
                    Like those above, violence is a subtle factor that finds difficulties in getting shown on the screen. 
                    It’s not rare to find a character conducting a dangerous, even cruel, skill to finish his or her enemies in Dragon Ball Z, 
                    which is widely known as focusing a lot on fighting. In manga version, those events are delineated with very real details, sometimes even frightening the readers.<br>
                    For example, considering the “debut” of Android 20, he had fully drained out an old man’s spirit and then snapped his neck like a tree branch. 
                    Definitely, this detail was cut off from the anime version and replaced by a more … gentle scene.        
                </p>

            <br>
            <li id="Release">
                <h3>3) Releasing Progress</h3> <br>
                <!--<img src="AttackOnTitan.jpg" alt="Attack On Titan 3 poster" width="100%" height="500vh"> <br>-->
                <p>
                    It’s pretty easy for a long-time fan to realize that Dragon Ball Z manga’s plot progress is much faster than that of anime. 
                    There is a technical term referring to the process of making an anime series, “fillers”, which means the empty spaces among a consistent storyline. 
                    They are the minor side stories of the characters, and they have nothing to work with the main plot.<br>
                    “Fillers”’ purpose is only to consume more time, and many fans hate those sporadic anime chapters as they just want to enjoy a fluent and smooth storyline.        
                </p>
            </li>
            <br>
            <li id="Strength">
                <h3>4) Is Super Saiyan Goku stronger than Frieza?</h3> <br>
                <!--<img src="Hakyuu.jpg" alt="Hakyu Hoshin Engi Poster" width="100%" height="500vh"> <br>-->
                <p>
                    In manga version, after reaching Super Saiyan, our Goku showcases an overwhelming power over Frieza. 
                    The victory seems strongly inclined to Goku. However, in Dragon Ball Z’s anime, the battle is not that easy, 
                    partly because the anime’s progress is much slower as mentioned above.
                </p>
            </li>
            <br>
            <li id="Finger">
                <h3>5) A redundant... finger</h3> <br>
                <!--<img src="Fairy.jpg" alt="Fairy Tail Poster" width="100%" height="500vh"> <br>-->
                <p>
                    Dragon Ball Z manga always sees many alien characters coming from outside the Earth, like Piccolo, have only four fingers. 
                    But anime authors frequently attach an additional finger into their hands, making those characters have five fingers totally.<br>
                    Many fans had complaint and asked the anime publisher – Toei – to bring Piccolo back his four-finger hands. 
                    Heart-achingly, this weird phenomenon also happened to his counterparts Buu and Cell. 
                    It seems like the publisher was trying to make those characters’ images become more “cute”, doesn’t it?   
                </p>
            </li>
            <br>
            <li id="Trunk">
                <h3>6) Trunks becomes Super Saiyan</h3> <br>
                <!--<img src="Ghoul.jpg" alt="Tokyo Ghoul:re poster" width="100%" height="500vh"> <br>-->
                <p>
                    In manga version, before Gohan’s death, Trunks is capable of reaching that level. 
                    In anime version, however, not until the moment he kneels next to his best friend’s corpse, his Super Saiyan power could be reached. 
                    Rage overflows all parts of his body – this is one of the most impressive moments of the series.
