                    It took three years for The Seven Deadly Sins to release the very next chapter, which is called Revival of The Commandments. 
                    This time, the story’s background is when Elizabeth, Liones’ Princess, 
                    bypasses the borderlines to herself initiate a reckless adventure to find the Seven Deadly Sins…

                <p>
                    Also “evaporating” in three years, One Punch Man 2 is expected to have a brilliant come-back with the appearance of a new character – Garou, 
                    an S-level superhero and also Bang’s disciple. Two superheroes Garou and Saitama both promise to bring about the most intense battles on the small screen.

                    Attack on Titan 3 will be released in the summer of 2018. 
                    The movie continues to tell the story of the battle between the huge and monstrous Titans and the human survivors. 
                    Soon, fans will be allowed to enjoy numerous epic fights with familiar characters like Eren, Mikasa, Armin, and so on.

                <p>
                    Hakyu Hoshin Engi is going to return to the small screen in 2018. 
                    Built upon a Chinese fairy tale about a team of angels sent to the Earth to rescue the people, 
                    Hoshin Engi 2018 is granted with a new plot but still keeps many main characters, especially Taikoubou and Supushan.

                    The last season of Fairy Tail, one of the “four pillars” of the publishing company Kodansha, will be released in 2018. 
                    This is a special come-back that every fan is long for, especially when its author Hiro is going to clarify all subtle and ambiguous details in previous episodes, 
                    leading to a satisfying closure of the story.

                    After three years, Tokyo Ghoul:re (the third season of Tokyo Ghoul) has returned to the small screen in 2018. 
                    Succeeding two previous chapters, the film surrounds endless battles between the ghoul (monsters that feed on bodies) and 
                    CCG – an organization found by humans whose purpose is to find and terminate the ghouls. 
                    After the Anteiku Purge, CCG’s impact becomes more and more influential, and the organization becomes too dangerous of a threat to the ghoul world, 
                    especially Aogiri – an organization aiming at leading the people to a more peaceful world.
