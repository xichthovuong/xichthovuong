                <h3>1) Liar Game</h3> <br>
                <img src="LiarGame.jpg" alt="Liar Game" width="100%" height="500vh"> <br>
                <p>
                    Considered to most "hacking-brains" of all time, Liar Game forces readers to "stretch" their minds, 
                    in which the psychological and mathematical fields need thoroughly exploiting.<br>
                    Liar Game is not just a lie to each other; it is a game for smart minds, full of tactics, brain battle, clever trick, and sharp inference. 
                    The most painful, cruel and real consequences make people lose faith in life.<br>
                    Toda Erika Kanzaki Nao, an innocent girl who believes in the absolute truth told by others, does not know how to lie and does not suspect others. 
                    Accidentally, one day, she received a box containing 100 million yen accompanied by a letter and a tape of LGT's Liar Game Guide.<br>
                    The rules are clear: The two sides must rob each other but are not allowed to use violence. 
                    The more they cheat the more money the win, and the loser will have to pay the LGT the money they got tricked (maximum is 100 million).<br>
                    She confused and brought the money to her teacher for help but did not expect to be blatantly robbed 100 million yen.<br>
                    In a panic, she was approached by a nearby police officer, who suggests contacting Akiyama Shinichi, a criminal psychology graduate, 
                    who had been released from prison following a fraudulent case that took down a large company. He agreed to join the game.<br>

                <h3>2) Tag</h3> <br>
                <img src="Tag.jpg" alt="Tag" width="100%" height="500vh"> <br>
                <p>
                    Tag is a mind-blowing and bizarre Japanese film in an interesting enough way to put forward its own philosophy. 
                    With just over 80 minutes in length, it just seems like a new test from Sion Sono.<br>
                    Tag left the Fantasia 2015 Film Festival with two Best Picture, Best Actress, along with the comment "creative, unexpected, with impressive opening scene."<br>
                    Indeed, hardly any of this year's scenes are memorable, bold and bloody as the two high school bus hauls cut in half by a lethal wind. That's how "Tag" began.<br>
                    The movie revolves around Mitsuko, the only survivor of the massacre on the bus. But when looking for helpers, 
                    she accidentally went to a school, and it’s bizarre that the people there and even the people who died on the bus said that she had originally belonged here. 
                    It was strange. However, when Mitsuko began to believe that all was a nightmare, she quickly got swept away by the fateful and bloody game of "destiny" available to her.

                <h3>3) Death Note</h3> <br>
                <img src="DeathNote2.jpg" alt="DeathNote" width="100%" height="500vh"> <br>
                <p>
                    Famous and well-known as manga, Death Note was adapted into a live-action television and film version.<br>
                    When it first debuted, the Japanese movie Death Note quickly overpassed The Da Vinci Code as the movie with #1 revenue, grossing a total of 5.5 billion yen in Japan alone. 
                    It became the most popular film in 2006.<br>
                    The main character Light, also called Kira, accidentally picked up the book in which "the name of the people written here will die." 
                    Initially, Light used the book as a means of punishing bad people, but then, things became out of control, the boundaries between right and wrong, 
                    black and white are no longer clarified.<br>
                    Before the injustices of the law and the help of Death, Light considered himself "the god of the new world," and allowed himself to write deadly deaths for the punished.<br>
                    This is considered lack of humanity and terrible, urging the international police and the world's most mysterious detective L have to examine.

                <h3>4) Confessions (2010)</h3> <br>
                <img src="Confessions.jpg" alt="Confessions (2010)" width="100%" height="500vh"> <br>
                <p>
                    Brainiac Japan Confessions is a phenomenon of Japanese cinema in 2010 and shortlisted Best Foreign Language Film at the 83rd Academy Awards.<br>
                    At the end of a lesson, female teacher Moriguchi revealed a harsh reality. Her daughter was murdered by two students in her class.<br>
                    Since children under the age of 13 will be exempted from all criminal responsibility, 
                    she has come up with a way of revenge by injecting HIV blood in the milk of the two students.<br>
                    The story of revenge is so simple, isn’t it? Confession is so complex and attractive that it makes the viewer surprised until the last minute.

                <img src="TwoSisters.jpg" alt="A Tale Of Two Sisters (2003)" width="100%" height="500vh"> <br>
                <p>
                    Two orphaned sisters live with their father and stepbrother. Their stepmother is always trying to torture and punish the two sisters.<br>
                    While the elder sister is strong, always trying to fight back, the other is weak. 
                    The elder sister worries that with increasing levels of violence, the stepmother is trying to finally kill them. Is that really true? 
                    A Tale of Two Sisters is a beautiful and haunting horror film about loneliness.

                <h3>6) Funky Forest: The First Contact (2005)</h3> <br>
                <img src="FunkyForest.jpg" alt="Funky Forest: The First Contact (2005)" width="100%" height="500vh"> <br>
                <p>
                    A sincere advice for those who want to watch this 2 hours 30 minutes Japanese movie is not to expect a clear and concise storyline even though it is labeled as a comedy.<br>
                    Produced by Katsuhito Ishii, Shunichiro Miki with the famous casts Rinko Kikuchi, whose performance could be seen in the Pacific Rim and Tabanobu Asano, 
                    who played Ichi the Killer, Funky Forest: The First Contact is a qualified and extremely “mind-blowing” Japanese movie.<br>
                    The film's plot revolves around three offending brothers: Masaichi, Masaru and Masao, who are trying to attract the attention of many girls.<br>
                    Fortunately, they finally get a chance to have a picnic with some female friends. 
                    The film will challenge your mind and melt it, as every single character in the movie finds itself in a variety of ways and all are connected in a certain way, 
                    from a listener, a guitarist, a white boy and a girl who is indifferent to everything.<br>
                    Interestingly, this movie is sometimes mixed with the cartoon scenes of two men in white suit arguing in front of the audience.<br>
                    The first half of the film is quite boring but still weird, while the second part of the movie is so amazing that you just say "what the hell is going on" right away.<br>
                    Funky Forest: The First Contact has garnered a lot of attention in Japan and around the world, with the screenshots of the movie becoming a meme prevalent in many social media.
